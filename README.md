## Usage

The Kellokortti mobile app is a versatile and user-friendly solution designed to revolutionize time tracking for businesses and employees. The app aims to simplify the process of clocking in and out, improving efficiency and accuracy in recording work hours. A few key features are listed below:

Kellokortti is an mobile application where an employee can sign themselves in and out of work, go for a lunch or notify of a personal leave of absence. The User can view their own information from the application, such as vacations, whether there are overtime hours and check from the calendar which tasks have been assigned to him.

Admin users are able to manage employees (add/delete), assign tasks/meetings to the calendar and examine hours worked by employees.
